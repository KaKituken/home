# Advanced Computer Vision Techniques

Computer vision has evolved dramatically with the introduction of deep learning. Let's explore some of the latest techniques that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## Attention Mechanisms

Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on specific parts of an image. The attention weight for position $(i,j)$ can be computed as:

$$\alpha_{i,j} = \frac{\exp(e_{i,j})}{\sum_{k=1}^{H}\sum_{l=1}^{W} \exp(e_{k,l})}$$

Where $e_{i,j}$ represents the energy at position $(i,j)$.

## Vision Transformers

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision by adapting the transformer architecture:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PatchEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_size=224, patch_size=16, in_channels=3, embed_dim=768):
        super().__init__()
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) ** 2
        
        self.projection = nn.Conv2d(
            in_channels, embed_dim, 
            kernel_size=patch_size, stride=patch_size
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.projection(x)  # (B, embed_dim, H/P, W/P)
        x = x.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2)  # (B, num_patches, embed_dim)
        return x
```

## Multi-Head Self-Attention

The core of transformer architectures is the multi-head self-attention mechanism:

$$\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O$$

Where each head is computed as:

$$\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)$$

## Applications

These techniques have enabled breakthroughs in:
- Object detection and segmentation
- Image generation and editing
- Medical image analysis
- Autonomous driving

The future of computer vision continues to be exciting with ongoing research in multimodal learning and few-shot learning approaches.
